      <description>Synopsis  Saeculum is first person immersive game designed to teach ancient Roman civilization in a full semester college course.
The game depicts four different time periods of Rome&amp;rsquo;s history, and students play as one of the ancestors of the Fulvii family through these different ages. In each time period, students learn about various issues that Rome faced at that time by exploring how the general population was affected, and talking with politicians, who were divided in their solutions for responding to the issues.</description>
